CaptchaTrader.py is a VERY SIMPLE class written in python that resolves captchas
using captchatrader.com

If you like this library and you don't have an account yet at captchatrader.com,
please, use my referer link: 

             http://captchatrader.com/users/refer/serhost/ 

so you will help me to test future versions of this library.

The use is VERY simple
======================

1) first you need to initialize CaptchaTrader with your own data:

    a = CaptchaTrader("Username", "Password", "API_KEY")

2) Now you can use its functions

    print a.getCredits()
    response = a.submitURL("http://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png")
    print "Ticket: ", response[0]
    print "CAPTCHA: ", response[1]
    a.respond(response[0],True);

Other examples:

    response = a.submitFilePath("/tmp/filetest.png")
    response = a.submit(open("/tmp/filetest.png", "rb").read().encode("base64"))

Methods avaiable in this version:

 - submitURL: Downloads the URL, encodes to base64 and then submits it
 - submitFilePath: Encodes the file to base64 and then submits it
 - submit: Simply sumbit a base64 string
 - getCredits: Get account credits
 - respond: Gives feedback about the submission: Correct or incorrect
